# <img src="./assets/Asset 3.png" alt="drawing" width="30"/> Public Patches Catalog
This is a public catalog of patches that [root.io](https://root.io) provides for various open source projects.\
These patches are used by the root.io platform which is a platform to auto-remediate vulnerabilities in container images.

## 🛠️ Inside the Catalog
The catalog is structured in the following way:

```txt
root/
├── <ecosystem>/
│   ├── <distribution>/
│   │   ├── <patch>/
│   │   │   ├── LICENSE
│   │   │   ├── diff.patch
│   │   │   ├── README.md
│   │   │   └── <other files...>
│   │   └── <other patches...>/
│   └── <other distributions...>/
└── <other ecosystems...>
```

## ✅ Project Status
This catalog is maintained by the root.io team.\
If you have any questions or need help, please reach out to us at 🌱 [root.io](https://root.io).
