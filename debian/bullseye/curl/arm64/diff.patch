+# Why CVE-2022-43551 is a False Positive for curl Builds Without HSTS Support
+
+## Overview: What Is `curl`?
+
+`curl` is a **command-line tool and library** for transferring data with URLs. It supports a wide range of protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, LDAP, DAP, DICT, TELNET, FILE, IMAP, POP3, SMTP and RTSP. curl is used in **command lines, scripts, and software applications** for automated data transfer operations.
+
+The tool is widely deployed in production environments, containers, and embedded systems for:
+- **HTTP/HTTPS client operations** - Making web requests and API calls
+- **File transfers** - Downloading/uploading files via multiple protocols
+- **API integrations** - RESTful service interactions and data exchange
+- **Automated workflows** - Scripted data retrieval and processing
+- **Network diagnostics** - Connection testing and troubleshooting
+
+---
+
+## What Is CVE-2022-43551?
+
+CVE-2022-43551 is a **vulnerability in curl** that affects **only when built with HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) support**. This issue involves **improper handling of HTTP redirects** in relation to HSTS, which could allow attackers to bypass HSTS expectations in vulnerable builds.
+
+---
+
+## Why CVE-2022-43551 is a False Positive in Debian Bullseye
+
+Security scanners (Trivy, Grype, etc.) often generate false positives due to:
+
+- CVEs linked to **version-based detection** without examining actual build configuration
+- Lack of awareness that **HSTS support is disabled** in Debian bullseye curl builds  
+- Version number matching without checking **compile-time feature flags**
+- Scanners assuming all curl builds have identical feature sets
+
+Manual intervention to "fix" CVE-2022-43551 in Debian bullseye containers will:
+
+- Fail because the **vulnerable code path doesn't exist**
+- Lead to unnecessary patching attempts and build failures
+- Create confusion about actual security posture
+- Waste time on non-existent vulnerabilities
+
+---
+
+# ‚ö†Ô∏è CVE Breakdown
+
+Below are details of CVE-2022-43551 frequently flagged but **not applicable** to Debian bullseye:
+
+---
+
+## üìå CVE-2022-43551 ‚Äì curl HSTS Redirect Handling
+
+- **Component:** `curl` with HSTS support enabled (versions < 7.86.0)
+- **Issue:** Improper HTTP redirect handling in HSTS enforcement
+- **Impact:** Potential HSTS bypass allowing HTTP connections instead of enforced HTTPS
+- **Affected Builds:** curl compiled **with HSTS support** 
+- **Bullseye Status:** ‚úÖ **NOT AFFECTED** (HSTS support disabled)
+
+### Why This Is a False Positive (Vulnerable Code Not Present!)
+
+- ‚ùå **HSTS feature disabled**: Debian bullseye curl is **not compiled with HSTS**
+- ‚ùå **No vulnerable code path**: The HSTS redirect handling code **doesn't exist**
+- ‚úÖ **Debian Security Tracker confirms**: "[bullseye] - curl <ignored> (curl is not built with HSTS support)"
+- ‚úÖ **Official source**: Debian maintainers deliberately disable HSTS in bullseye builds
+- ‚úÖ **Binary verification**: `curl -V` shows **no HSTS** in features list
+
+**‚úÖ Verification on Debian Bullseye:**
+```bash
+curl -V    # Look for 'Features:' line; absence of 'HSTS' means not vulnerable
+```
+
+If you do **not** see `HSTS` listed in the features, the binary is **not susceptible** to CVE-2022-43551.
+
+**‚úÖ Recommendation:**  
+Mark CVE-2022-43551 as **NOT AFFECTED / FALSE POSITIVE** for Debian bullseye. The vulnerable feature is **not compiled in**.
+
+---
+
+## Summary
+
+- CVE-2022-43551 affects curl **only with HSTS support** (< 7.86.0)
+- Debian bullseye curl **deliberately excludes HSTS** from build configuration
+- This is a **false positive** in container vulnerability scans
+- Patching attempts will **fail because vulnerable code is absent**
+- **Official Debian confirmation**: Marked as "ignored" due to disabled HSTS
+
+**üìå Best Practice:**  
+Document CVE-2022-43551 as **FALSE POSITIVE** for Debian bullseye curl and exclude from actionable vulnerability reports.

+# Why You Cannot Fix `curl` CVE-2023-23914 via Code Patching in Containers
+
+## Overview: What Is CVE-2023-23914?
+
+CVE-2023-23914 is a vulnerability in curl versions prior to 7.88.0 related to HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) functionality. The issue causes HSTS mechanisms to fail when multiple URLs are requested serially, potentially allowing cleartext transmission of sensitive information.
+
+**Technical Details:**
+- **Component:** HSTS functionality in libcurl
+- **Issue:** HSTS state not properly carried between subsequent transfers on the same command line
+- **Impact:** HTTPS enforcement may be bypassed, leading to potential cleartext transmission
+- **Affected Versions:** curl < 7.88.0 with HSTS support enabled
+
+---
+
+## Why CVE-2023-23914 Is a **FALSE POSITIVE** for Debian Bullseye
+
+### üîπ 1. HSTS Support Not Compiled in Debian Bullseye
+
+According to the [Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-23914):
+
+- **Debian bullseye**: curl 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u13 - **`<ignored>` (curl is not built with HSTS support)**
+- **Status**: The vulnerable HSTS functionality is **not included** in the Debian bullseye curl build
+- **Conclusion**: ‚úÖ **Cannot be exploited** - the vulnerable code path does not exist
+
+### üîπ 2. Build Configuration Excludes Vulnerable Feature
+
+- Debian bullseye's curl package was compiled **without HSTS support**
+- The vulnerable HSTS state management code is not present in the binary
+- This is a deliberate build-time decision by Debian package maintainers
+- Scanners cannot detect build-time feature exclusions, only version numbers
+
+### üîπ 3. Version vs. Feature Mismatch
+
+- **Package Version**: 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u13 (appears vulnerable by version)
+- **Build Reality**: No HSTS support = no vulnerability exposure
+- **Scanner Limitation**: Tools flag based on version ranges, not compiled features
+- **Result**: False positive due to feature absence
+
+---
+
+## **Recommended Action: Mark as False Positive**
+
+This CVE should be marked as a **False Positive** because:
+
+1. **Feature Not Built**: The HSTS functionality containing the vulnerability is not compiled into Debian bullseye curl
+2. **Code Path Unreachable**: The vulnerable HSTS state management code cannot be executed
+3. **Scanner Limitation**: SCA tools cannot detect build-time feature exclusions
+4. **No Action Required**: The vulnerability cannot be exploited as the functionality is absent
+
+## **Specific CVE Details: CVE-2023-23914**
+
+**CVE ID**: CVE-2023-23914  
+**Package**: curl  
+**Debian bullseye Version**: 7.74.0-1.3+deb11u13  
+**Status**: **FALSE POSITIVE** - HSTS functionality not built in distribution
+
+### **Description**
+**HSTS functionality fail when multiple URLs are requested serially**
+
+A cleartext transmission of sensitive information vulnerability exists in curl <v7.88.0 that could cause HSTS functionality to fail when multiple URLs are requested serially. Using its HSTS support, curl can be instructed to use HTTPS instead of using an insecure clear-text HTTP step even when HTTP is provided in the URL. This HSTS mechanism would however surprisingly be ignored by subsequent transfers when done on the same command line because the state would not be properly carried on.
+
+**Technical Details:**
+- **Introduced by**: [commit 7385610](https://github.com/curl/curl/commit/7385610d0c74c6a254fea5e4cd6e1d559d848c8c) (curl-7_74_0)
+- **Fixed by**: curl 7.88.0+ via [PR #10138](https://github.com/curl/curl/pull/10138)
+- **Root Cause**: HSTS state not properly maintained between sequential transfers
+
+### **Why This Is a False Positive for Debian Bullseye**
+1. **HSTS Not Compiled**: The curl package in Debian bullseye lacks HSTS support entirely
+2. **Feature Absence**: The vulnerable functionality simply does not exist in the binary
+3. **Build Decision**: Debian maintainers deliberately excluded this feature from the bullseye build
+4. **Cannot Exploit**: No code path exists to trigger the vulnerability
+
+---
+
+## **Evidence from Debian Security Tracker**
+
+Direct quote from [Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2023-23914):
+
+> **[bullseye] - curl `<ignored>` (curl is not built with HSTS support)**
+
+This official designation confirms that:
+- The vulnerability is **ignored** for bullseye (not flagged as needing fixes)
+- The reason is explicit: **HSTS support is not built**
+- Debian security team has already determined this is not a concern for bullseye
+
+---
+
+### **Recommended: Mark as False Positive**
+- Add CVE-2023-23914 to your scanner's false positive/exception list for Debian bullseye curl
+- Document the reasoning: "HSTS functionality not compiled in Debian bullseye build"
+- Reference the official Debian Security Tracker determination
+- Monitor for any changes in future Debian bullseye curl updates that might include HSTS support
