+# Why CVE-2022-43551 is a False Positive for curl Builds Without HSTS Support
+
+## Overview: What Is `curl`?
+
+`curl` is a **command-line tool and library** for transferring data with URLs. It supports a wide range of protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, LDAP, DAP, DICT, TELNET, FILE, IMAP, POP3, SMTP and RTSP. curl is used in **command lines, scripts, and software applications** for automated data transfer operations.
+
+The tool is widely deployed in production environments, containers, and embedded systems for:
+- **HTTP/HTTPS client operations** - Making web requests and API calls
+- **File transfers** - Downloading/uploading files via multiple protocols
+- **API integrations** - RESTful service interactions and data exchange
+- **Automated workflows** - Scripted data retrieval and processing
+- **Network diagnostics** - Connection testing and troubleshooting
+
+---
+
+## What Is CVE-2022-43551?
+
+CVE-2022-43551 is a **vulnerability in curl** that affects **only when built with HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) support**. This issue involves **improper handling of HTTP redirects** in relation to HSTS, which could allow attackers to bypass HSTS expectations in vulnerable builds.
+
+---
+
+## Why CVE-2022-43551 is a False Positive in Debian Bullseye
+
+Security scanners (Trivy, Grype, etc.) often generate false positives due to:
+
+- CVEs linked to **version-based detection** without examining actual build configuration
+- Lack of awareness that **HSTS support is disabled** in Debian bullseye curl builds  
+- Version number matching without checking **compile-time feature flags**
+- Scanners assuming all curl builds have identical feature sets
+
+Manual intervention to "fix" CVE-2022-43551 in Debian bullseye containers will:
+
+- Fail because the **vulnerable code path doesn't exist**
+- Lead to unnecessary patching attempts and build failures
+- Create confusion about actual security posture
+- Waste time on non-existent vulnerabilities
+
+---
+
+# ‚ö†Ô∏è CVE Breakdown
+
+Below are details of CVE-2022-43551 frequently flagged but **not applicable** to Debian bullseye:

+
+## üìå CVE-2022-43551 ‚Äì curl HSTS Redirect Handling
+
+- **Component:** `curl` with HSTS support enabled (versions < 7.86.0)
+- **Issue:** Improper HTTP redirect handling in HSTS enforcement
+- **Impact:** Potential HSTS bypass allowing HTTP connections instead of enforced HTTPS
+- **Affected Builds:** curl compiled **with HSTS support** 
+- **Bullseye Status:** ‚úÖ **NOT AFFECTED** (HSTS support disabled)
+
+### Why This Is a False Positive (Vulnerable Code Not Present!)
+
+- ‚ùå **HSTS feature disabled**: Debian bullseye curl is **not compiled with HSTS**
+- ‚ùå **No vulnerable code path**: The HSTS redirect handling code **doesn't exist**
+- ‚úÖ **Debian Security Tracker confirms**: "[bullseye] - curl <ignored> (curl is not built with HSTS support)"
+- ‚úÖ **Official source**: Debian maintainers deliberately disable HSTS in bullseye builds
+- ‚úÖ **Binary verification**: `curl -V` shows **no HSTS** in features list
+
+**‚úÖ Verification on Debian Bullseye:**
+```bash
+curl -V    # Look for 'Features:' line; absence of 'HSTS' means not vulnerable
+```
+
+If you do **not** see `HSTS` listed in the features, the binary is **not susceptible** to CVE-2022-43551.
+
+**‚úÖ Recommendation:**  
+Mark CVE-2022-43551 as **NOT AFFECTED / FALSE POSITIVE** for Debian bullseye. The vulnerable feature is **not compiled in**.
+

+
+## Summary
+
+- CVE-2022-43551 affects curl **only with HSTS support** (< 7.86.0)
+- Debian bullseye curl **deliberately excludes HSTS** from build configuration
+- This is a **false positive** in container vulnerability scans
+- Patching attempts will **fail because vulnerable code is absent**
+- **Official Debian confirmation**: Marked as "ignored" due to disabled HSTS
+
+**üìå Best Practice:**  
+Document CVE-2022-43551 as **FALSE POSITIVE** for Debian bullseye curl and exclude from actionable vulnerability reports.

+
+## Overview: What Is CVE-2022-42916?
+
+CVE-2022-42916 is a vulnerability in curl that affects **only when built with HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) support**. The issue involves IDN hostname conversion interacting with HSTS, which could bypass HSTS expectations in vulnerable builds.

+
+### Why This Is a False Positive (Vulnerable Code Not Present!)
+
+- ‚ùå **HSTS feature disabled**: Debian bullseye curl is **not compiled with HSTS**
+- ‚ùå **No vulnerable code path**: The HSTS/IDN interaction code **doesn't exist**
+- ‚úÖ **Debian Security Tracker confirms**: "[bullseye] - curl <ignored> (curl is not built with HSTS support)"

+
+If you do **not** see `HSTS` listed in the features, the binary is **not susceptible** to CVE-2022-42916.
+
+**‚úÖ Example Output (Safe):**
+```
+curl 7.74.0 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu) libcurl/7.74.0 ...
+Features: AsynchDNS HTTPS-proxy IPv6 Largefile libz NTLM NTLM_WB SSL TLS-SRP
+Protocols: dict file ftp ftps gopher http https imap imaps ...
+```
+**Note:** No `HSTS` in Features = Not vulnerable
+
+**‚úÖ Recommendation:**  
+Mark CVE-2022-42916 as **NOT AFFECTED / FALSE POSITIVE** for Debian bullseye. The vulnerable feature is **not compiled in**.

+
+## Summary
+
+- CVE-2022-42916 affects curl **only with HSTS support** (< 7.86.0)
