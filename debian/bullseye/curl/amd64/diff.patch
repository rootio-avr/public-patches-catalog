++## Why CVE-2022-43551 is a False Positive for curl Builds Without HSTS Support
++
++## Overview: What Is `curl`?
++
++`curl` is a **command-line tool and library** for transferring data with URLs. It supports a wide range of protocols including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, LDAP, DAP, DICT, TELNET, FILE, IMAP, POP3, SMTP and RTSP. curl is used in **command lines, scripts, and software applications** for automated data transfer operations.
++
++The tool is widely deployed in production environments, containers, and embedded systems for:
++- **HTTP/HTTPS client operations** - Making web requests and API calls
++- **File transfers** - Downloading and uploading files via various protocols  
++- **Automation scripts** - Part of CI/CD pipelines and deployment scripts
++- **System monitoring** - Health checks and service validation
++- **Data integration** - ETL processes and data synchronization
++
++---
++## 📌 CVE-2022-43551 – False Positive for curl without HSTS
++
++**Component:** `curl` HTTP client library with HSTS support  
++**Issue:** A vulnerability exists in curl <7.87.0 HSTS check that could be bypassed to trick it to keep using HTTP. The HSTS mechanism could be bypassed if the host name in the given URL first uses IDN characters that get replaced to ASCII counterparts as part of the IDN conversion.  
++**Impact:** HSTS bypass allowing HTTP connections instead of enforced HTTPS.
++
++---
++
++## 🔍 Vulnerability Overview
++
++- **Component impacted:** `curl` with HSTS support enabled (versions < 7.87.0)
++- **Nature of issue:** HSTS bypass via IDN character manipulation in hostname processing
++- **Severity:** Medium (CVSS ~5.9) 
++- **Attack vector:** Network-based HSTS bypass
++- **Affected code:** `lib/http.c` HSTS parsing functionality
++
++---
++
++## ✅ curl – Why This is a False Positive
++
++- **HSTS support is disabled** in many distribution builds, including Debian bullseye
++- In **Debian bullseye, curl is not built with HSTS support**
++- The vulnerability only affects **HSTS-enabled builds** of curl
++- **No security impact** when HSTS functionality is not compiled into the binary
++- **Debian Security Tracker confirms**: "[bullseye] - curl <ignored> (curl is not built with HSTS support)"
++- The vulnerable code path (`Curl_hsts_parse`) is **not executed** when HSTS is disabled
++- **Build-time configuration** determines whether HSTS code is included
